# hello-world

Hello!

I am a 14 Years Old Junior High Student that learn how to program independently.
For me it's quite tough to learn because English is not my native language, so i struggled to learn from Free PDFs and Free online courses which is use english in it.
well, though there is a course or book with my native language, i will not take it, i love English!
and then i want to be a technology developer one day..

currently i can program with C.
